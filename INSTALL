Requirements
============

libsdl1.2
libsdl-mixer1.2 (if compiled with -DSDL_MIXER)
libsdl-image1.2 (if compiled with -DSDL_IMAGE)
(libjpeg)

Installation
============

1. Untar the file
2. Edit src/Makefile :
     -DSDL_MIXER is needed for audio support, disable it if you didn't
      install the SDL_mixer headers.
     -DSDL_IMAGE is needed for "non BMP" image loading, if you didn't
      install the SDL_image headers, you unfortunately need to convert
      all "non BMP" images to bmp images and change the names in the
      source. It's needed... ;)
     -Note: libjpeg is needed for jpeg image support
     -Check the optimization flags.
3. Run: make lost_vikings
4. Run: ./lost_vikings
