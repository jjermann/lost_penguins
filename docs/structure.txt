========

weapon chooses enemies!!!!????

attack(dest,weappool["Fireball"])
attack(obj,weappoll["Fireball"]) {
    
}


Character:
virtual void attack()
weaponspool

Objects:
virtual void hit(Weapon* weap)


type:
  - touch (run speedanims):
      o plant
      o tomator
      o fish?
      o laser barrier
  - explosion
      o bomb
  - pressure:
      o fart
      o run
      o jump
      o block (sb)
      o bridge (sb)
      o dense obj (sb)

effects that trigger a hit in certain conditions:
   o block fall => if the way is blocked below hit(down, type: pressure, massive damage)
                => prevented by shield
   o water      => hit's each idle with water touch????
   o bridge     => if the way is blocked hit pressure
   o dense obj  => when hit with state_fall2 (same for left, right)?? =>
                   l/r/u no damage, down damage



TODO: add die function for monsters (eg. hamburgers)


problem: difference between weapon hit and effect?

solution:
effects=enter(),touch(),act(),...
effects are used internally to check what is happening, they are
triggered by the active element and controlled by the passive element!
eg. viking falls down with state_fall2 _touching_ (triggering)
touch(direction) of the ground => ground's touch sends a hit(pressure)
to the viking => viking checks state_fall2 and takes damage

weapon hits=hit()
a weapon hit is a response to an attack/effect
weapon hits are triggered by:
  - player (active: input)
  - ai (active: ai program)
  - effects (passive)
the hit is controlled by the "damaged" element!


problem: when to call hit(weap) and when to call attributes directly

solution1: generally if damage could be involved call hit, otherwise not
solution2: everything is a hit
solution3: never call hit









dense types:
 - monsters: VIKINGS, DENSE OBJECTS (for non ghosts)
 - vikings:  MONSTERS, DENSE OBJECTS
 - tomator:  DENSE OBJECTS

enemy types (only for monsters?):
 - monsters: VIKINGS
 - vikings:  MONSTERS


example return of checkHit:
 - dense | dir == VIKING|DENSE|dir
 - DENSE | dir
 - VIKING|MONSTER|DENSE|dir
 - MONSTER|dir
 - MONSTER|DENSE|dir

if it contains dense => stop
if it contains enemy => attack







EVENTS
======

general:
  - _one_ current event for each object allowed
  - possible to check if it's empty or not
  - start, during, end
  - strikt duration? => tleft?
  - can be updated (eg. running)
  - abort if hit/whatever

  - scheduled (with remaining time???)
  - 

attack:
  - duration till hit
  - change image
  - apply damage at end
  - abort if hit


jump/wing/etc:
  - duration => fixes the scorch maxspeed hack
