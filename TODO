TODO:
=====

 o IDEA: change Animation* pointers to Animation (or references), leave only
   animation as a pointer and get the address each time...

 o cleanup the files (move out objects, separate .h, etc)

 o introduce animation events that play an animation and end when it's
   finnished (always ESTATE_BUSY or abort animation?)

 o allow an event length depending on animation length, or: relate events more
   with animations!!!

 o change hit to play the right death animation/sound, change water to hit
   characters...

 o PROPER PLACEMENT CODE (and IDEA: allow moves from NULL and/or to NULL),
   units should be placed in a way they won't give conflicts, examples:
     - teleport should really teleport (above ground if possible)
     - if a unit's position is too low and it dies the dead corps is
       illegaly placed!
     - the placement should somehow involve checkPlace...

 o FIX ALL BUGS! hahaha:
     - the right/left movement stays when a busy animation starts!
     - the zombie doesn't turn from a wall
     - hit event
     - zombie attacks too often if nearby
     - in short: rewrite zombie
     - the new speed system doesn't always work (eg right move, ctrl before
       release, etc, very buggy :()
     - segfaults when doing sthg while the current viking is dying...

 o IDEA: add horizontal gravity that slows objects down??

 o move object creation code (addObjectByName) to the objects

 o create dynamical plugins for all objects (or compile all in)

 o IMPROVE?: cleanup set_difference stuff => targets should be updated if
   an object dies in an intelligent way...

 o Structure/Cleanup:  
     - DONE?: fall logic including gravity!!
     - DONE?: viking, object, item, ai, weapons, character
     - PART DONE: effect management (periodic events, permanent effects, etc)
     - DONE: hitlogic
     - IDEA: merge otype and ctype and make all moves/etc depend on it

 o Add attributes:
     - crushable (ie. weapon fart, jump, run destroys them?)
     - bombable (ie. bomb destroys them)
     - multistates? => bridges, door, stone block

 o Maybe: Improve the (very simple) image format:
     - All frame in one sprite sheet for each character (image matrices
       using two description vectors or even more general: offset matrices)
     - store rects in an array/vector/whatever or use offset matrices
     - do some column/row logics to easy the access
     - eg. set offsets for left, right, mleft, mright...
