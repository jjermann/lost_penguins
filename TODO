Bugs
====
 o the zombie doesn't turn from a wall
 o hit event
 o zombie attacks too often if nearby
 o in short: rewrite zombie
 o memleaks, segfaults?


Code
====

 o General:
    o pointers => references where possible
    o cleanup the files (move out objects, separate .h, etc)

 o Animations/Events:
     o Make all events quite short, ie. almost all events become animation
       events
     o Maybe: Improve the (very simple) image format:
        - All frame in one sprite sheet for each character (image matrices
          using two description vectors or even more general: offset matrices)
        - store rects in an array/vector/whatever or use offset matrices
        - do some column/row logics to easy the access
        - eg. set offsets for left, right, mleft, mright...
     o IDEA: change Animation* pointers to Animation (or references), leave only
       animation as a pointer and get the address each time...
     o introduce animation events that play an animation and end when it's
       finnished (always ESTATE_BUSY or abort animation?)
     o allow an event length depending on animation length, or: relate events more
       with animations!!!

 o Placement code:
     o IDEA: allow moves from NULL and/or to NULL
     o units should be placed in a way they won't give conflicts, examples:
        - teleport should really teleport (above ground if possible)
        - if a unit's position is too low and it dies the dead corps is
          illegaly placed!
        - the placement should somehow involve checkPlace...

 o Plugins:
     o move object creation code (addObjectByName) to the objects
     o create dynamical plugins for all objects (or compile all in)

 o Ideas/Improvements:
     o IMPROVE?: cleanup set_difference stuff => targets should be updated if
       an object dies in an intelligent way...
     o IDEA: merge otype and ctype and make all moves/etc depend on it
     o IDEA (old): Add attributes:
        - crushable (ie. weapon fart, jump, run destroys them?)
        - bombable (ie. bomb destroys them)
        - multistates? => bridges, door, stone block


Progress
========

 o DONE?: fall logic including gravity!!
 o DONE?: viking, object, item, ai, weapons, character
 o PART DONE: effect management (periodic events, permanent effects, etc)
 o DONE: hitlogic
