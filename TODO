Bugs
====
 o zombie (bug in movement!, attacks too often, use events, etc...)
 o key vs. trigger in map2
 o fall event (DONE?)
 o players die event segfault (eg. olaf)


Code
====

 o General / Interface:
     o (BIG) move drawing to the objects/menus/etc (create a draw() function)!
     o pointers => shared_ptr/references where possible
     o Complete the doxygen documentation and keep it up-to-date
     o Use Singletons
     o Create a better class hierarchy so we don't have a class playground...
     o Better handle the different game states and replace the current conditional model
     o IDEA: Use boost to support better constructors (name loading)
     o IDEA: create dynamical plugins for all objects (or compile all in)

 o Move/crash/collisions:
     o move should be a property of a common object
     o Hit should give either much more information or all logic should be done inside
       move (BAD)
     o collision reactions should depend on the corresponding types and whether we
       already are near the object or not => getCollisionType(obj1,obj2)?
     o First priority (first run): find out where the object will move to (HARD)
       => add a bool notchange parameter and pass it on to all actions
     o movement into a movable object should just move the object
     o if the movement is "forced" the moved object should be hit hard when it collides
       otherwise a hit would stop the moving object as well...
     o I have no idea about how the push should look like, elevators can be pushed
       up, even though you don't collide with them on top
     o IDEA: characters should be "pushable", eg. a stone that falls down pushes the
             character down or better: an elevator should push the characters up
     o In case of the elevator, the players are somehow "bound" to the elevator (ie.
       it's not like: the elevator moves, the character falls, but they move together)
       Solution: The elevators move function checks all objects it would
         hit, if they are pushable (not dense) they are moved first if
         possible. If it's not possible, do sthg else (stop the elevator and hit the
         object/whatever)...
     o IMPROVE?: cleanup set_difference stuff => targets should be updated if
       an object dies in an intelligent way...
     o IDEA: merge otype and ctype and make all moves/etc depend on it
     o IDEA (old): Add attributes:
        - crushable (ie. weapon fart, jump, run destroys them?)
        - bombable (ie. bomb destroys them)
        - multistates? => bridges, door, stone block
     o REWRITE: the whole crash system!!!

 o Events/Animations:
     o Replace the anim_orig by a base rectangle
     o Invent more intelligent and more robust! fallback methods for animations
     o Allow empty animation, decouple (put more logic in) these relations:
       object (pos, draw?), game(time, state, handler), gfxeng(draw), animation(empty,
       frame, update, time, draw)?, frame, global/current (public, private) properties
     o IDEA: couple left and right animations somehow to reduce the code size
        - eg. set offsets for left, right, mleft, mright...
     o IDEA: just store one side and add some flipping logic to the image
          loading process...
     o allow an event length depending on animation length, or: relate events more
       with animations!!!
     o REWRITE: the whole event system!!!

 o Scenario:
     o Add some nice animation, text box, etc when a level was completed (including printing
       the map name).
     o Simplify the scenario class and drastically reduce the public variables!!

 o Placement code:
     o IDEA: allow moves from NULL and/or to NULL
     o units should be placed in a way they won't give conflicts, examples:
        - teleport should really teleport (above ground if possible)
        - if a unit's position is too low and it dies the dead corps is
          illegaly placed!
        - the placement should somehow involve checkPlace...


Progress
========

 o Monsters / AI: VERY BAD
 o Game functionality (): BAD
 o Events / Effects: BAD, MESS, NESTED
 o Object (including parameter) loading: BAD
 o Move logic: ACCEPTABLE, BUGGED, NESTED
 o Objects (players, items, etc): ACCEPTABLE
 o Physic Handler: ACCEPTABLE, NESTED
 o Input Handler: ACCEPTABLE, WORKS
 o Scenario: OK, MESS, WORKS
 o Collision detection: OK
 o Fall logic: GOOD
 o Animation / Image structure: VERY GOOD
