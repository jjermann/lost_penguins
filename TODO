TODO:
=====

 o EVENTS WON'T WORK VIRTUALLY!!!!!!
   Idea: events for each character as private/protected functions

 o move object creation code (addObjectByName) to the objects

 o create dynamical plugins for all objects (or compile all in)

 o cleanup Speed/tmpspeed mess, idea: only y speed! no x speed

 o cleanup set_difference stuff => targets should be updated if an object
   dies in an intelligent way...

 o DONE? Fix Memleaks
 
 o pointers => references where possible

 o Structure/Cleanup:  
     - PART DONE: fall logic including gravity!!
     - PART_DONE: viking, object, item, ai, weapons, character
     - IMPROVE: effect management (periodic events, permanent effects, etc)
     - IDEA: find a better trigger/effect system
     - DONE: hitlogic
     - IDEA: remove touch, enter and call them in checkMove?
     - IDEA: merge otype and ctype and make all moves/etc depend on it
     - IDEA: allow moves from NULL to NULL

 o Add attributes:
     - crushable (ie. weapon fart, jump, run destroys them?)
     - bombable (ie. bomb destroys them)
     - multistates? => bridges, door, stone block

 o Add new objects:
     - ladder
     - rope
     - "deadly edges"
     - electric fence

 o Monsters?:
     - stone?
     - plant
     - knight
     - dragon
     - skeleton
     - fish
     - firetower
 
 o Weapons?:
    - fireballs
    - sword
    - claw
    - run 
    - fart
    - jump
    - arm

 o Items?:
    - bomb
    - life

     - eric run
     - baleog swing (hard one)

 o Improve viking bar management

 o Add better graphics

 o finnish the map editor

 o Maybe: Improve the (very simple) image format:
     - All frame in one sprite sheet for each character (image matrices
       using two description vectors or even more general: offset matrices)
     - store rects in an array/vector/whatever or use offset matrices
     - do some column/row logics to easy the access
     - eg. set offsets for left, right, mleft, mright...

 o OpenGL

 o Simple AI

 o Menu
